Public Cloud:
Who Uses It: Everyone, like individuals, businesses, and organizations.

What It's Like: Imagine a giant, shared computer space on the internet. It's like using apps, storing files, or doing tasks on the internet that anyone can access.

Example: Think of Google Drive or Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Private Cloud:
Who Uses It: One specific organization or business.

What It's Like: Picture having your own personal, private computer space. It's like a digital clubhouse where only you and your team have access. Others can't just drop in.

Example: A company using its own server for all its digital needs.

Hybrid Cloud:
Who Uses It: A mix of everyone, depending on needs.

What It's Like: It's like having your private computer space, but sometimes you use the shared internet space too.

Example: A business storing sensitive data in its private space but using the public cloud for extra storage or specific tasks.
